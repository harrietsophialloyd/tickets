## Brief
As a team we developed a web application based on a specification that has been provided to us, within 4 weeks. The concept is a web-hosted application that Atos employees can access to post help tickets to a publicly accessible help queue.

The application is a Spring Boot Help Queue application with full CRUD functionality for practical use as a support ticket system which will demonstrate what we have all learnt through-out our training programme. We are expected to produce a basic CI pipeline to integrate and deploy new code as it is created. 

### Additional Requirements
In addition to what has been set out in the brief, we included the following: 
* A fully functioning Help Queue web application deployed in an GCP virtual machine.
* Full documentation of the system, including project development, risk assessment, component level diagrams and installation instructions.
* A simple automated CI system, also with full documentation discussing how the tools were utilised.
* A 30 minute presentation that demonstrates:
   * our team's project management approach (team roles, sprints, product backlog, priorities, etc.)
   * the functioning application and the features that were implemented
   * the functioning CI pipeline with a fully automated rolling update
