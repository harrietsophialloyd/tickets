## Brief
The brief provided to us for this project sets the following out as its overall objective:
"To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training."

In other words, I have been tasked with creating an application that utilises create, read, update and delete functions in order to function, such that I can demonstrate that I've learnt something over the last few weeks.
